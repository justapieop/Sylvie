### Set Up the Bot for Your Own Server  
- Replace the server ID (main text, voice and rules channel) and roles ID (admin and default) in `config.py`.
- Make a copy of `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`
- Fill in the blanks (your Discord bot token and other tokens)
- Run `main.py`.
### Programming the Bot Yourself  
- This is my pet project, so it's frequently updated (and the code is functional).
- I believe my code is fully functional and well-organized. Have fun reading!
